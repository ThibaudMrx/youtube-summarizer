    1.a Saint Laurent Island is located near Gambel in Alaska, close to the Bering Sea. In October 2022, two Russians sought asylum here, fleeing Russia due to Putin's military mobilization for Ukraine.
    1.b The Distance between Saint Laurent Island and the Russian coast is approximately 65 km.

    2.a The Bering Strait separates Chukotka, an autonomous region of Russia, from Alaska, the westernmost part of North America. It lies between the Arctic and Pacific oceans.
    2.b Historically significant for trade of fur, the Bering Strait was the transit route for Russian colonies in America and saw the establishment of Russian outposts in Alaska and even California. The Bering Strait was the symbol of tensions between Russia and the United States during the Cold War, known as the "Bering Strait Crisis."

    3.a Currently, issues in the region revolve around Arctic ice melt affecting geopolitical interests. Climate change is causing the Arctic to warm four times faster than the rest of the planet, leading to a loss of approximately 40% of the ice cap's surface since 1980. The strait is now regularly navigable year-round due to reduced ice cover.
    3.b A new commercial route, the Northeast Route, is emerging between Pacific and European ports. This route reduces shipping distance from Shanghai to Rotterdam by approximately 6760 km compared to the traditional route through the Strait of Malacca and Suez Canal. The Northwest Route could link West Coast USA to Europe, reducing distance by 12,770 km compared to passing through the Panama Canal. Increased shipping via the Bering Strait is expected due to new commercial routes, with potential for further reduction in transit distances via the North Pole route (Transpolar Route).

    4.a Russia asserts its power and influence in the Arctic. 83% of gas produced in Russia and 17% of its oil come from the Arctic. The Arctic is estimated to contain 22% of undiscovered global hydrocarbon reserves according to USGS estimates.
    4.b Zones Économiques Exclusives (ZEEs) extend up to 200 nautical miles (360 km), and can be extended if a country proves its continental shelf extends that far. Dispute over the Lomonosov Ridge, which contains significant hydrocarbon resources, between Russia, Canada, and Denmark exists.

    5.a Mourmansk is a key point for Russia's Arctic expansion due to its year-round operable port, making it a base for fishing, including the catching of Barents Sea cod within Norway’s EEZ and international agreements. The port supports the nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, extracting gas and oil from the Arctic, and serves as a potential hub for exports to European and Chinese markets.
    5.b Russia has strengthened its military bases along the Arctic coast since the invasion of Ukraine, with the Murmansk region playing a strategic role due to the presence of the Céveraumorsk base, the principal base for the Northern Fleet. Base houses two-thirds of Russian submarines and an airbase in Olenya. Permanent soldiers stationed: 25,000 - 30,000.

    6.a The U.S. is expanding the port of Nome to monitor Bering Strait approach. F-35 has been relocated to Fairbanks airbase and an anti-missile base built at Delta Junction. A US military base in Pytoufik, Greenland, is a key element in their anti-missile system.
    6.b Sweden joined NATO in fall of 2023 and 2024, making the Arctic a strategic point of conflict between Russia and Western powers. China views the Arctic as strategic due to shorter routes avoiding Suez and Malacca congestion. China, declared a near-Arctic nation in 2018, is equipping penguins, building icebreakers, and has been spotted Chinese icebreaker in Murmansk port. Cooperation between Russia and China exists in the Arctic region.
