The text is about Saint Laurent Island in Alaska, located near Gambel and the Bering Sea.
Two Russian citizens arrived on a small boat in October 2022 seeking asylum in the United States, fleeing Russia due to Vladimir Putin's order of mobilization for war in Ukraine.
The island is approximately 65 km from Russian coast and is the closest point where Russia and the United States are geographically close.
The Bering Strait separates Chukotka, an autonomous region in Russia, and Alaska, a state in the United States.
The Two Diomede Islands, only 3 km apart, with the smaller Diomede being American and inhabited by a hundred people, and the larger Diomede, Russian and uninhabited since 1948.
The Bering Strait connects the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.
Historically, the Bering Strait was significant for Russian trade colonies in Alaska and even California during the fur trade era, and later became a symbol of Cold War tensions between Russia (then USSR) and the United States. Today, it is affected by Arctic ice melt.
April 2014 to 2018, the Strait was free of ice for the first time since observations began.
Climate change is accelerating in the Arctic four times faster than on the rest of the planet.
The Arctic ice has lost about 40% of its surface area over the past 40 years and could entirely disappear during summer months by 2035.
The Strait, which was covered with ice for six months per year in the 1980s, is now navigable throughout winter.
A new commercial route, the Northeast Route, is emerging between Pacific and European ports.
This route could reduce shipping distance from Shanghai to Rotterdam by 15,790 km compared to the traditional route through the Strait of Malacca and Suez Canal (19,550 km).
The opening of the Strait to regular navigation could also connect the west coast of the United States to Europe via the Northwest Route, reducing distance from Hamburg to 12,770 km compared to the Panama Canal route (17,100 km)
Navigation remains risky due to shallow waters and icebergs.
Current annual traffic through the Bering Strait is about 50 ships compared to 80,000 through the Strait of Malacca, 17,000 through the Suez Canal, and 15,000 through the Panama Canal.
Traffic in the Bering Strait is increasing over time.
In the long term, a polar route could further reduce transit distances.
The new maritime routes would position Russia at the center of global commercial exchanges and intensify its maritime links with China, its main trade partner and oil supplier.
Climate change is perceived as an economic and political opportunity by Russian leaders, as access to natural resources becomes easier.
Russia is reasserting its territorial claims in the Arctic.
Vladimir Putin has made the Arctic a priority for affirming Russian power, as 83% of Russia's gas and 17% of its oil come from the Arctic.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Arctic Ocean could hold 22% of undiscovered hydrocarbon reserves worldwide.
Zones Economiques Exclusives (ZEE) extend 200 nautical miles from a country's coast, but can be extended to 350,000 nautical miles if a country proves its continental shelf continues beyond that point.
Dispute over the extension of the continental shelf: Russia vs Canada and Denmark over the Kara Sea (Orsale Lomonosoph with significant hydrocarbon resources.)
Diplomatic provocations due to territorial claims without international agreements.
In 2007, Russia planted a flag at 4600 meters under the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole.
Mourmansk is the most populous city north of the Arctic Circle with 280,000 inhabitants.
Mourmansk's port operates year-round due to the passage of the North Atlantic Drift (NAD), a warm ocean current.
Mourmansk serves as Russia's gateway to the Arctic and its natural resources, with key industries including fishing, nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, and potential hub for LNG exports to Europe and China.
Political instability in the region: Russia has strengthened military bases along its Arctic coastline since the invasion of Ukraine.
Mourmansk hosts the main base of the Northern Fleet, with Céveraumorsk being the most significant facility at 25 km from Mourmansk.
Base houses two-thirds of Russian Submarines and an airbase at Olénya, with 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers stationed permanently.
US is expanding the port of Nome to monitor Bering Strait approach.
F-35 fighters relocated to Fairbanks airbase and anti-missile base at Delta Junction.
Abandoned US military base in Greenland is key to their anti-missile system again.
Sweden joined NATO in autumn 2023 and 2024, increasing strategic Arctic tension between Russia and Western powers.
Russia and China see strategic interest in the Arctic due to warming, allowing for a Northern route avoiding Suez and Malacca congestion.
China, located 1500 km from the Arctic Circle, is equipping penguins, operating vessels in Arctic waters, and cooperating with Russia in the region (Sinorus)
