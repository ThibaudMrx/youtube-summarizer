imagine you are a school teacher and this is your raw text notes, without any segmentation whatsoever
Segment the following text into logical paragraphs. 
    Ensure each paragraph covers a key idea or topic. Provide the output as a numbered list:
aim to have arround 3-5 key topics, each consisting of arround 3-5 smaller topics.  you want to give your students an understandble layout of the lesson. it is key to have two indetation levels : the first is the grand scheme, and the second the ideas. because it is a lesson, each idea should be understandle on its own, its not a reference
